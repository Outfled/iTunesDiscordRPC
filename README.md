__Outfled Discord RPC Client for iTunes__

__Built for Windows only__

This program connects to the iTunes application and tracks your current listening activity. The program will then connect to Discord & display the song details as your current activity.

__By default, song album cover images are NOT displayed in the Discord RPC status; instead the iTunes icon logo image is used. If you would like to display the album cover image, a few additional steps are required.
Read the 'iTunesDiscordRPC with Album Cover Images' section.__

## Installation:
__If you don't care about album cover images being shown in the RPC status, you can download the release and just run the exe: https://github.com/Outfled/iTunesDiscordRPC/releases__
